**Hi, I'm Jan**👋, a student from Germany. In my freetime, I like to read, particularly sci-fi, coding and stargazing.

#### ℹ️Info

This site is my personal space on the web, where I can post whatever I want. Most of the content comes from an Obsidian vault, synced through a GitHub repository. Instead of being organized linearly, the content is connected through related topics and tags.
